        <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>

        <p>
            Introduction: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) leads to cognitive problems in childhood and
            adolescence, and due to its associated hyperkinesias, it may also result in behavioral problems, which can
            lead to negative impressions amongst one’s peers. Objective: To assess the impact of hyperkinesia reduction
            on the attention and behavior profiles of three children with the combined type of ADHD following an
            intervention featuring psychoactive medication. Methods: This pilot study was conducted at the Laboratory of
            Learning Difficulties and Disabilities and Attention Disorders (DISAPRE-UNICAMP). Objective data (including
            mean values of amplitude and frequency of movement over 24 hours) were obtained using an actigraph (a
            clock-like device), a behavioral assessment scale (the Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]), and the Strength
            and Weakness and ADHD Symptoms Normal Behavior (SWAN) rating scale (which was administered by clinicians and
            school staff members); these were cross-referenced to compare the children’s performance before and after
            the use of psychoactive medication. The treatment was introduced after 15 days and maintained thereafter for
            30 days, and the results were statistically analyzed by means of actigraphic variables (L5 and M10) and by
            student’s t-test (P < 0.05). Results: There was a simultaneous reduction in the actigraphic index, the
            attention deficit scores of hyperactivity for both the CBCL and SWAN, and the somatic disorder symptom
            scores of the CBCL. These results were statistically significant when examining the pre- and post-medication
            data for each individual in the sample. Conclusion: The reduction in hyperkinesias in the three patients
            with ADHD resulted in improvements in inattention, somatic symptoms, and emotional symptoms.

        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobiological development disorder that affects, on
            average, 3% - 6% of children and adolescents. Its prevalence rate is about 5.29% and it is the most common
            neurobehavioral disorder in this age group and one of the most studied neuropsychiatric conditions in recent
            times ( Castellanos & Tannock, 2002 ; Barkley, 1997 ; Polanczyk, Lima, Horta, Biederman, & Rohde, 2007 ). It
            is characterized by its chronic nature, and it features a predominantly polygenic etiology, which means that
            the affected individual shows signs and symptoms of attention deficits, high distractibility, hyperactivity,
            impulsivity, disorganization, and emotional inadequacy when faced with experiences that require
            self-regulation within the environment ( Sobanski, Banaschewski, Sergeant, & Faraone, 2010 ). The diagnosis
            is clinical in nature and based on the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
            Disorders (DSM-IV); these criteria were recently updated in the DSM-5 ( American Psychiatric Association,
            1994 ; American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ).
        </p>

        <p>
            These patients tend to experience adjustment difficulties when confronted with emotional conflicts; they do
            not tolerate rules, routines, repetition, or sudden changes in priorities, and they leave monotonous
            activities or responsibilities until the last minute. They avoid allocating mental effort to less
            pleasurable activities or to those without immediate reward, and these individuals often provoke discomfort
            among their peers by not assuming coherent positions exhibiting empathy impairments or by not adhering to
            routines of daily conduct. Additionally, they are often shy and withdrawn with new contacts or in new
            situations requiring flexibility and consideration of multiple strategies ( Sobanski, Banaschewski,
            Sergeant, & Faraone, 2010 ).
        </p>

        <p>
            In this sense, the behavior of a person with the combined type of ADHD leads to chronic and recurrent
            difficulty in anticipating the demands of his or her surroundings; this triggers a process of maladjustment
            between their pace and the pace of the environment around them. Therefore, in this subtype, socio-affective
            detriments in the family and at school, externalized behavior, and sleep and eating disorders are present,
            while those with the inattentive subtype typically tend to manifest academic problems and internalized
            symptoms ( Sobanski, Banaschewski, Sergeant, & Faraone, 2010 ). These characteristics can be analyzed by
            structured behavioral assessment scales, which can be administered by those who live in closest contact with
            their children, parents and teachers. Some studies have shown that families who have children or adolescents
            with ADHD are busier, more stressed, and have a worse quality of life than those who do not have children
            with ADHD, as these children rely on their parents’ frequent monitoring and caution to orient these children
            to follow rules and routines within the household environment and at school ( Phelan, 2005 ; Marta, Rose,
            Laura, Jaume, & Montse, 2011 ).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to understand these patients’ levels of attention deficit, unrest, and agitation, as well as
            their poor inhibitory control, as these generate destabilization. These symptoms are directly related to
            numerous stress factors and negative emotional symptoms, both at school and within the family. Adequate
            control of these behaviors has been highly related to quality of life improvements among the child and those
            around them, especially when pharmacological treatment with psychostimulants is introduced. In these
            instances, we see an almost immediate reduction in hyperactivity, excessive inattention, and other
            externalized symptoms ( Brown et al., 2005 ; Haertling, Mueller, & Bilke-Hentsch, 2015 ; Zelnik &
            Terkel-Dawer, 2015 ). In order to objectively measure the hyperkinetic behavior of patients with combined
            ADHD, an actigraphic device, or an actimeter, can be used. It evaluates and analyzes, in real time, the
            amplitude and frequency of the child’s excessive movements and swaying behaviors 24 hours a day, whether the
            child is in a structured environment or not. It uses actigraph variables to analyze a child’s movement
            parameters, which are referred to as interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV), and the mean
            amplitude of M10 and L5. With respect to evaluations, behavioral scales are typically used; they are
            subjective in nature and employ natural observations. These scales are also related to the child’s
            interactions with his or her peers. The scales have been validated and reliability supported by experience
            and evidence-based research on statistically secure sampling. For this study, the instruments used were the
            Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Strength and Weakness and ADHD Symptoms Normal Behavior (SWAN)
            rating scale, which are sensitive and suitable for checking global and attentional patterns of behavior,
            respectively; these scales may be applied by both parents and teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The objective of this study is to verify the impact of hyperkinesias on the behaviors of the studied sample
            using two axes of evaluation: 1) the use of scales to evaluate the children’s behaviors, as perceived by
            parents and teachers (these perceptions were then associated with and cross-checked against actigraphic
            registers); and 2) indices recorded by the actigraphic device, which was continuously worn by the children
            throughout the survey period. The impact of hyperkinesias on behavior can be assessed by peers’ perceived
            reductions in the child’s hyperactivity, as well as by monitoring the effects of this reduction on the
            child’s productivity and attention. Moreover, these impacts can be determined if effective reductions are
            reflected by improvements in actigraphic indices and across sub-items on behavioral assessment scales.

        <h3>2. Materials and Methods</h3>

        <p>
            Three patients diagnosed with the combined type of ADHD were recruited; these patients met the DSM-5
            criteria for this subtype of ADHD, and they were outpatients chosen from the Laboratory of Learning
            Difficulties and Disabilities and Attention Disorders (DISAPRE-UNICAMP). Males and females between the ages
            of 8 - 13 years, those who did not receive any type of previous treatment or intervention, and those in
            middle or lower socioeconomic classes were selected. All of these participants were invited to sign the
            informed consent form (ICF-CNS 466/12), and only then were they included in the study.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inclusion criteria: 1) Children with a confirmed diagnosis of the combined type of ADHD, as established by
            the DSM-5 criteria; 2) parental consent and signature of the ICF by the same; and 3) children between 7 and
            12 years of age.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exclusion criteria: 1) Children and adolescents with epilepsy, learning disorders, or any other neurological
            condition that provokes movement restrictions due to postural overload or motor sequel, such as
            cerebrovascular accidents and scoliosis; 2) children being treated with anti-histamines or neuroleptic or
            psychotropic medication; 3) children aged 13 years older or those below 7 years of age; and 4) children with
            an allergic or idiosyncratic reaction to any medication that will be used in this study.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following submission to, and upon receiving approval from, the Research Ethics Committee, protocol number
            159/2010, the children began their participation in the study. The children received a formal diagnosis of
            ADHD, either the hyperactive or combined type, by a clinical team, as based on established diagnostic
            protocols. Then, the informed consent forms (per the resolution of the National Health Council-CNS 466/12),
            were signed by the responsible parties and sent from the database at DISAPRE/UNICAMP. The subjects included
            in the study are described below:
        </p>
        <p>
            Subject 1 is a male patient, 8 years and 10 months of age, who was a single-born, full-term infant, and who
            was adequate weight for gestational age at birth without perinatal complications. The patient comes from a
            low-middle socioeconomic status. He attends public school in the municipality of Santa Bárbara d’Oeste (SP),
            where he is in his fourth year of elementary school, and has achieved good academic standing. He was
            diagnosed with the combined type of ADHD.
        </p>
        <p>
            Subject 2 is a female patient, 11 years and 1 month of age. She is the first-born of two children, and she
            was carried to term without perinatal intercurrences. She is from a middle-class family, and she is attends
            private school in Campinas (SP). She is currently in her seventh year of elementary school II and has
            achieved good academic standing. She was diagnosed with the combined type of ADHD.
        </p>
        <p>
            Subject 3 is a 12-year-old male patient. He is an only child, and he comes from a lower socioeconomic
            status. He is a public school student in Mairinque (SP), where he is currently in his seventh year of
            elementary school II. He was diagnosed with the combined type of ADHD.
        </p>
        <p>
            Three children and adolescents, aged 8, 11, and 13 years old, and each with a diagnosis of the combined
            subtype of ADHD, were evaluated during the study. They were instructed to use an actigraphic device for a
            period of 45 days. This group of children was not treated during the first 15 days of the study; however, in
            the 30 days thereafter, these children were subsequently treated with psychoactive medication.
        </p>
        <p>
            The children were evaluated using two instruments: the CBCL, which was completed by the children’s parents
            or responsible caregivers (this version of the scale was suitable for children aged 6 - 18 years), and the
            SWAN rating scale, which specifically measures attentional abilities. Both scales were administered at time
            zero by the author of this study, and they were subsequently administered by a certified psychologist on the
            40th day of the study. The SWAN rating scale was also completed by the children’s school counselors and
            teachers. The teachers and counselors administered these instruments at time zero (during the non-medicated
            period of the study) and 45 days later (30 days after the medication was first administered) in the school
            environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The CBCL was administered to the children and their parents by experienced professionals, and the data were
            analyzed using specific CBCL software. Children and adolescents were classified based on the test results,
            and the findings were analyzed by the children’s age, using the general American population’s results on
            this scale as a control. The SWAN rating scale, in turn, was administered by experienced medical
            professionals (SWAN-C) and by teachers or school coordinators (SWAN-E) to the patients’ parents, and the
            data were analyzed by the author in accordance with the scale parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the actigraphic records, the Act Trust (clock-like) device developed by Condor Instruments was used
            ActStudio software. The participants were instructed on how to use the device, and they were provided with
            the guidance necessary to avoid imbalances and/or deviations in the results. The device was placed and fixed
            on the upper, non-dominant limb, like a watch. Said instructions followed the 2002 Protocol of Practical
            Parameters for the use of an actigraph, according to Littner et al. (2003) . All participants would wear the
            device 24 hours a day, for 45 days. The device contains mechanisms that prevent the individual from
            disabling or modifying its operation. The device is activated via its specialized software program, and the
            recording time of the device’s registration was determined by the research team.
        </p>
        <p>
            The records for each participant were subsequently analyzed, computed, and recorded in specific software
            that featured a registry of containing the specific measures recorded by the actigraph, as well as counters
            and circadian variables. The circadian variables include IS, IV, and the mean amplitude of M10 and L5.
        </p>
        <p>
            IV allows us to report on rhythm fragmentations in daily activity. Its calculation is based on the first
            derivative of the grouping of the actigraph data on an hourly basis, and it is represented by the following
            equation:
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/01.png">
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            where the first derivative is the result of the subtraction between previous movement elements
            (<img src="img/02.png" alt="">) and subsequent elements (Xi) from the untreated data. From this first
            derivative, the root mean square is calculated by <img src="img/03.png">, and the results are normalized by
            the population variance, <img src="img/04.png">. Ample time periods are required to analyze how the amount
            of daily sleep and wake times increase the IV value.
        </p>
        <p>
            IS provides information on the synchronization between rest-activity rhythms and the light-dark cycle, and
            it is calculated based on the average values of a 24-hour day. IS can be represented by the following
            equation:
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/05.png">
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            where N is the total number of data obtained, p is the number of data per day (24 points in this case), Xm
            is the average of all obtained data, Xh provides a profile of the average hour, and Xi represents each hour
            in sequence. The IS, in short, is calculated as the variance of the average daily profile, divided by the
            total variance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nocturnal activity, measured by the nonparametric variable L5, reflects the average activity that occurs in
            the 5 hours featuring the lowest amount of movement for the day. Diurnal activity, in turn, is measured by
            variable M10; it is a variable that reflects the average activity of the 10 most active hours in a given
            day. High M10 values are found in people with a very restless or hectic lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
            The calculation of the difference between nocturnal and diurnal activity generates values that highlight the
            amplitude of the activity-rest rhythm. Low-amplitude values are frequently observed in individuals with
            certain medical conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, those with high amplitudes are assumed
            to be in better health. The amplitude of the rest-activity cycle (RA) can be verified by means of the
            following formula:
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/06.png">
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Retrospectively, the data were analyzed using SPSS; furthermore, the L5 and M10 variables were analyzed
            offline. The differences in the measured parameters between the non-medicated and medicated phases were
            statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). In addition, the differences between times were
            compared and subsequently correlated to the circadian variables; they were also cross-checked by means of
            multiple regression, using clinical data such as gender and age, whether the children were treated or not,
            and whether the children were in a state of sleep or wakefulness, etc. The technical variations in the
            calibration of the apparatus were respected.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to reduce the signs of hyperkinesia, a psychoactive medication (long-acting methylphenidate;
            Ritalin) was chosen. A dose of 10 mg of the medication was administered twice daily, at 8 a.m. and 1 p.m.
            The children were not given the treatment at night. This daily dose was adequate for all individuals in this
            study, as their weights and heights were similar. The medication was introduced after 15 days of
            non-treatment, and the children continued to receive it for 30 days. The data produced by the scales and by
            the actigraph were cross-checked before and after medication use. In order to determine whether there were
            any differences between the means of the total scale score and the T Score indices before and after the
            medication was taken, Student’s paired t-test was applied, and the significance level was set to P = 0.05.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Results</h3>

        <p>
            A reduction in the actigraphic indices was confirmed overall (Table 1), and there was also a corresponding
            reduction in the attention deficit and hyperactivity scores across both the CBCL and SWAN scales.
            Furthermore, there was a decrease in the CBCL symptoms associated with somatic disorders (Table 2). These
            results were statistically significant for each individual included in this study, after pairing the sample
            data both pre- and post-medication administration. Table 1 shows the mean, median, and standard deviations
            of the indices for the Total Score and T score scales, and the respective P-values for Student’s paired
            t-test.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the three patients studied, the actigraphic records revealed a reduction in daytime and nighttime
            hyperkinesia, even during sleep, when comparing the records obtained between the pre- and post-medication
            stages. As shown in Table 1, the M10 data decreased, on average, by 91.99% among the three patients in the
            study after introducing the psychoactive medication. Additionally, an average reduction of 65.89% was
            observed across the L5 parameters. Of note, only the variations in L5 were statistically significantly
            relevant, indicating that there was a greater reduction in hyperkinesias during rest (i.e., during sleep)
            (Table 1).

            With respect to the results obtained on the CBCL (Table 2), after the introduction of the psychoactive
            medication, there was a demonstrated reduction in the behavioral inadequacy indices for both internalizing
            and externalizing symptoms, but statistical significance was only found for somatic problems and attention
            problems. Upon studying the results of the SWAN scale (Table 2), a significant reduction of ADHD symptoms
            was observed, but only when analyzing the results of the scale administered by clinical staff (SWAN-C).

        <h3>4. Discussion</h3>

        <p>
            The overall evaluation of the results showed that the use of psychoactive medication among the three
            patients studied herein resulted in reduced hyperkinesia. The existing literature is extensive and redundant
            when demonstrating the effectiveness and quick action of methylphenidate in patients with ADHD, as this
            medication reduces associated symptoms and actigraphic indices, while improving quality of life scores or
            scores that reflect activities in the classroom or labschool environment ( De Crescenzo et al., 2014 ; Uebel
            et al., 2016 ; Haynes, Lopez-Romero, & Anand, 2015 ). In fact, some research emphasizes how there are
            decreases in inattentive indices, increases in performance during structured activities, and improvements
            across neuropsychological tests when medication administration is measured with the use of an actigraph
            unit, as in the case of monitoring medication use while implementing the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) (
            Edebol, Helldin, & Norlander, 2013 ).
        </p>
        <p>
            Both in parallel and comparatively, the behavioral assessment scales and the specific scale for ADHD (SWAN)
            also showed a significant reduction in the scores related to somatic problems and attention deficits in all
            individuals in the study sample, especially when assessed by clinicians in a double-blind scenario; when the
            scale was administered by the school, such statistical value was not observed. The use of scales by teachers
            and non-specialists naturally raises concerns due to the lack of experience and the lack of expertise
            required to translate observations into clinical parameters. Moreover, the difficulty faced while assessing
            the intensity of a particular behavior may explain the lack of comparative significance when the SWAN scale
            is applied by teachers and school staff members (SWAN-E). However, in this study, precautions were taken to
            account for the competence of those administering the survey, as well as to ensure that these individuals
            were being well prepared to take part in the study; they were additionally guided by the clinical team that
            conducted the study. This scale is easy to use and it is accessible for application by education
            professionals; it can also be administered for various study purposes within the realm of ADHD ( Brites,
            Salgado-Azoni, Ferreira, Lima, & Ciasca, 2015 ), although it is important to note that when the SWAN scale
            was applied in a double-blind scenario by the clinical team (SWAN-C), there was a significant reduction in
            the attention deficit score.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the data were matched at an individual level, and comparisons were made between the phase in which the
            children received medication and the phase in which they did not, we can conclude that for each individual
            in the study, the reduction in hyperkinesias during times of rest had improved the children’s inattention
            and somatic problems. The association between excessive restlessness and attention loss is directly
            proportionate, which is in accordance with the current findings in the literature. Furthermore, the
            actigraphic records are similar for patients with either the inattentive type of ADHD or those with the
            combined type ( Dane, Schachar, & Tannock, 2000 ). Obviously, we cannot draw the same conclusion when
            considering the three patients together, as the sample is obviously inadequate. Similarly, we cannot
            definitively affirm that the psychoactive medication was solely responsible for this effect. Even so, it
            appears that the pharmacological effect was really the only constant variable that was altered during the
            survey period, and the introduction of the same seemed to have solely influenced the results reported here.
            In addition, the validity and reliability of the actigraphic methodology for recognizing ADHD, which was
            achieved by analyzing the behavioral profile (observations) and objective records (rapid oscillations) of
            the three children in a naturalistic environment, was able to give the obtained data a higher level of
            veracity when paired with the behavioral results expressed in the scales ( Kam et al., 2010 ; Gonçalves,
            Adamowicz, Louzada, Moreno, & Araújo, 2015 ). This was the case even in relatively short periods of time (15
            - 40 days), which was in accordance with current chronobiological models.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this pilot study, the use of psychoactive medication, and the consequent reduction of hyperkinesias, was
            not sufficient enough to reduce the negative impact of ADHD on behavior in general; however, these methods
            were proven to be effective for improving somatic symptoms and attention-related problems. It is important
            to note that during this study, the patients remained under observation for 45 days; if this model were
            extended for a greater period of time, the outcomes may have differed, despite the evidence that indicated
            how short intervals of measurement are often sufficient for observing clinical results ( Martin-Martinez et
            al., 2012 ). Conversely, this fact may also have contributed to the finding that the negative perceptions
            held by family members and school staff members toward the hyperkinesias observed in this sample were not
            effectively or convincingly modified. Of note, individuals exhibiting these types of behavioral disorders
            often do not see modified perceptions and evaluations from their peers for a long period of time after any
            behavioral improvements first appear; it may simply be the case that these observations may suffer from
            subjective interference.

        <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>

        <p>
            As such, this study showed a direct relationship between the reductions in actigraphic indices and
            improvements in somatic symptoms and attention deficits following the introduction of psychoactive
            medication. However, due to the small sample size employed in this investigation, the results were not
            sufficient enough to infer and conclude that medication use, as a single variable, was effective in reducing
            either the children’s inappropriate behaviors or their actigraphic records. We are aware of methodological
            restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this paper could serve as model to new researches with big samples and future statistical
            excellence. Besides, it can be used to clinical analyses more objective for medication evaluation on ADHD
            assessment.
